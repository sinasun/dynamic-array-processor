# Java Project: DynamicArrayProcessor

This is a Java project that demonstrates the use of a dynamically allocated array and its processing. The project consists of two classes: `DynamicArrayProcessor` and `Numbers`.

## DynamicArrayProcessor Class

The `DynamicArrayProcessor` class contains the main method of the program. It allows the user to interactively perform various operations on an array of numbers. The available operations include initializing a default array, specifying the maximum size of the array, adding values to the array, displaying the values in the array, calculating the average, finding the minimum and maximum values, and more.

## Numbers Class

The `Numbers` class represents a collection of numbers. It provides methods for adding values, finding the minimum and maximum values, calculating the average, and more. The class contains a dynamically allocated array to store the numbers. The size of the array can be specified during initialization or set to an infinite size.

## Usage

1. Compile the Java source files: `DynamicArrayProcessor.java` and `Numbers.java`.
2. Run the compiled class file for the `DynamicArrayProcessor` class.
3. Follow the prompts to perform the desired operations on the array.
4. Choose the corresponding option by entering the provided number.
5. Provide valid inputs as required.
6. View the results of the selected operation.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until you choose to exit the program.
